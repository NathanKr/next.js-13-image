<h2>Motivation</h2>
check how width 100% (aspect ratio) is working with Image component on next.js 13 vs next.js 13 and img

<h2>Points of interests</h2>
<ul>
<li>in next.js 12 i needed width and height of the image</li>
<li>in next.js 13 i did not need width and height of the image .Only the image aspect ratio was used on the container padding top</li>
</ul>
